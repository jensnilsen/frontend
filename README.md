# frontend

A projekt built for mendly. The idea is to make the CBT tools they have interactive. For now its just a glimpse of the final project. The final project is ment to be used IRL and deployed. 

As is now:
admin and user login.
Admin can assign a task to user. 
User gets the task in a list.
opening a task and finishing it will update the task and put it self in a list over done tasks.

Coming up:
admin will become u therapist user. handling results from tasks.
specific user and therapist endpoints will connect to each other. 
more tasks, models and text 
might be a coment field to the tasks or perhaps a small chat to every part. 


Other things thats going to change.
Implementing better state handler. (redux)
cleaning up code and split up in to components.
